# ember-uikit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anehx/ember-uikit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anehx/ember-uikit)

This addon is a wrapper for the CSS library [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)
which exposes certain components to give users an easy way for using UIkit in
ember apps.

**WARNING: This addon is still very much in beta! Contributions are welcome.**

## Installation

Install the ember-cli addon in your ember-cli project:

```shell
$ ember install ember-uikit
```

This will also install `ember-cli-sass` and add the needed SASS include to `app/styles/app.scss`.
